# tracedpromise

`TracedPromise` is a class based on the standard ES6 Promise API that adds [OpenTracing instrumentation](http://opentracing.io) to the promise.

## Getting started

Install with `npm`. (*Note: you may need a relatively recent version of NPM to support scoped packages*.)

```bash
npm install --save opentracing-tracedpromise
```

See `src/examples/demo.js` for a short example.
